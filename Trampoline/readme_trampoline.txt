In order to perform all the tests in a cleaner way, three different files were employed, one for each case.
Of course in the testing phase the chosen case related file was renamed periodic.c
All tests were performed under the ubuntu terminal with windows subsystem for linux.
All tests were performed inside the trampoline/examples/posix/periodic folder.
